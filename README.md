# Hello-world
The sonofman
Hello World, my name is Jeremiah, I celebrated my 22nd birthday just 2 days ago. I am a tech newbie with a lot of passion. Currently studying Java with hopes of becoming a software dev. I have a lot of passion for the tech world which makes it amazing that it took so long for me to make the transition.
Anyways, here I am. Welcome to my MULTI-VERSE, I hope you enjoy my tech journey as much as I am.
Here are the programming Languages I want to learn in order of how I hope to study them
1. Java
2. Python
3. Javascript (Optional)
4. React

If you're reading this and you're in a position similar to mine, or you could offer some kind of mentorship, contact me. I'm more than eager to learn and participate in projects that would broaden my experience and knowledge. Also feel free to contact me and correct me if you notice I'm getting it wrong at some point. 

WELCOME WORLD
